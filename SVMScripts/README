chisq_kernel.py
Calculates ``A'' by cross-validation as described in chi-squared_definition.docx as
well as the ``D(H_i, H_j)'' for the train set (train x train) and test set (test x train),
dumping the results to a file (TODO: fixup the format so it can directly be used by
libsvm standalone scripts)

map_for_svm.py
Calculates the mAP off the tags predicted by libsvm's svm-predict on a trained model

svm_predict.py
Trains an SVM, collects the predicted outputs, saves the SVM, and then calculates
and returns the mAP

representation_extraction.py
Extracts the previous-to-last layer representation of the data from the given model
(e.g.: to be used as input for an SVM)
